# William Guss 

I am a computer scientist and mathematician from Salt Lake City, Utah. I currently study at UC Berkeley and work part-time at [Bonsai AI](http://bons.ai) making AI that use other AI to solve problems. A large part of my time is devoted to Machine Learning at Berkeley ([ML@B](http://ml.berkeley.edu/)), a research/consulting organizaton I cofounded in 2015. [[bio](./bio)]

My goal is to understand human intelligence by creating artificial intelligence.

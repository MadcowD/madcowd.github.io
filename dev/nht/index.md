# Neural Homology Theory
<img src="/public/nhomologytheory.png" width="100%" />

The learnability of different neural architectures can be characterized directly by computable measures of data complexity. Neural homology theory gives a complete topological description of the power of neural networks with applications in [architecture selection](empirical) and computational topology.

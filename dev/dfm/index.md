Deep funciton machines (DFMs) are a generalization of deep neural networks proposed to 
connect topology in data to topology in neural networks. DFMs act on vector spaces of arbitrary (possibly infinite) dimension and in fact certain DFMs are invariant to the dimension
of input data; that is, the parameterization of the model does not directly hinge on
the quality of the input (eg. high resolution images). DFMs provide an expressive
 framework for designing new neural network
layer types with topological considerations in mind.

I'm an entrepreneur and PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](http://ml.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon. I've been involved in the ML and AI since early 2013, and have held various academic and industry positions. 

Notably, I cofounded [Machine Learning at Berkeley](http://ml.berkeley.edu) which has become the central focal point of the academic, industrial, and entrepreneurial ML community at UC Berkeley. During my time as an undergraduate at Berkeley, I was endowed a $100,000 grant by Amazon to compete as a finalist and team leader in Amazonâ€™s natural language generation and dialogue systems competition, the [Alexa Prize](https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize). I've also held advisory positions at various AI/ML startups in the bay area such as [Bonsai AI](http://bons.ai), with a focus in automatic and meta-machine learning. 

Currently, I'm  a cofounder at an algorithmic cryptoptocurrency hedgefund, [Infoplay AI](infoplay.com) in addition to my research in deep learning theory and deep reinforcement learning advised by Professor [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/).
